# Python 3
Python 3 practice
I have made a program to print out a backward pyramid according to user input how many layers they want to print.
It includes a validation of user input at begaining. 
It is my first python home work code given by Raj(a nice, kind,knowledgeable colleague). It is finally work very well now with Raj's help. :). Lucky me. Feel free to check this code. 
To run this in windows, make sure you have python 3 above installed, then use below command to run it in PowerShell:
python firsthw.py
